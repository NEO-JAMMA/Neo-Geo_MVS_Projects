- This supergun works with all MVS and Atomiswave (use the Kick Harness pins for Atomiswave)
- Depending on your setup you might have to cut/solder the test jumper (usually one slot MVS use the Jamma test pin - Multi-slot use the MVS).
- For best image/sound quality use a shielded cable.

Parts:
- 1 * 28 pins Jamma Connector
- 3 * RM065 500 Ohm Potentiometer
- 3 * Button 6mm x 6mm x 12.5mm
- 4 * 16V 220UF 6x7mm Electrolytic Capacitors
- 1 * KCD2-202 DPDT Switch 6 pins 21X15mm
- 1 * Mini Din9 9 Pins Connector
- 1 * Molex 4 pins (PC connector) (Optional With Direct Stereo Audio/5 volts mod)
- 1 * Power Jack Socket 2.1mm x 5.5mm Barrel-Type PCB Mount
- 2 * Header 3 pins 2.54mm
- 2 * DR25 25 Pins Male right angle (D-SUB 15)
- 2 * Led 3mm (Orange & Red)
- 7 * Resistors
    - 1 * 470 Ohm
    - 1 * 330 Ohm
    - 1 * 680 Ohm
    - 2 * 1K Ohm (Optional With Direct Stereo Audio/5 volts mod)
    - 2 * 10K Ohm (Optional With Direct Stereo Audio/5 volts mod)

Optional parts:
- 1 * 2 pins Dupont Cable Female Connector Wire 2.54mm Pitch 30cm (For Stereo Audio connection directly to the MVS)
- 1 * Header 3 pins 2.54mm (For Kick Harness)
- 1 * KF301-2P 5.08mm 2 Pins Connect Terminal Screw (External 5 Volts/12 Volts)
- 1 * Header 8 Pins Male Socket Double Row Right Angle 2.54mm
- 1 * 3F07 Audio Jack Connector PCB 5 Pins

For the sound:
- If you have the stereo modification on your MVS just put the two wires (left-right) on the "DIRECT" connector. you can power the board by the barrel jack (only 5 volt needed).
- if you don't have the stereo modification you need to use the two jumper on "LEFT" and "RIGHT" and you need to use the Molex connector 5V/12V.
